# Want to mask your voice?

This is a dirt cheap way of doing it!

### Dependencies

A normal Mac can run this. Requires `python` and `say`. Along with `pocketsphinx`:

```sh
$ brew install --HEAD watsonbox/cmu-sphinx/cmu-sphinxbase
$ brew install --HEAD watsonbox/cmu-sphinx/cmu-pocketsphinx
```

### Usage
```sh
$ python run.py 
# Now speak into your computer's mic and watch and marvel as your computer 
# inaccurately parrots your speech!
```
